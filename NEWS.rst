News for sak
============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more
detailed list of every change, see the Git log.

Latest
------
* Major: Updated API for resource_pool.hpp. The pool now also supports
  calling a custom recycle function on objects as they get recycled
  back into the pool.

11.1.1
------
* Bug: Add missing include for size_t definition in easy_bind.hpp

11.1.0
------
* Minor: Added support for const member function in sak::easy_bind
* Minor: Adding optional_bind which is a small helper function
  occasionally useful when writing generic code where some types define
  specific member function and some do not. If that is the case
  optional bind will allow us to bind to a member function if available
  otherwise optional bind will return a predefined return value.

11.0.0
------
* Major: Renamed the sak::storage comparison function equal(...) to
  is_equal(...).
* Minor: Added a sak::storage comparison function is_same(...) to
  check whether two storage objects point to exactly the same data.
* Minor: Updated waf to 1.8.0-pre1.
* Bug: Started using pep8 style for python files.

10.4.0
------
* Minor: Adding easy_bind.hpp template functions which removes the
  need to manually insert placeholders for unspecified arguments.

10.3.0
------
* Minor: Remove MSVC-specific code from aligned_allocator (variadic
  templates are now supported by MSVC)
* Minor: copy_storage now skips copying if the two buffers are the
  same
* Minor: file_input_stream unit test deletes the created file after
  the test
* Bug: Fix file_input_stream issues on iOS by checking for EOF in
  read_position()

10.2.1
------
* Bug: Fixed bug in the conversion functions for big endian platforms.
  Reported by Martin Hundeb√∏ll.

10.2.0
------
* Minor: Added random_buffer class that can be filled and verified
  using an embedded random seed
* Minor: Updated to waf-tools 2
* Minor: Update to waf 1.7.10
* Minor: Remove unused boost::signals
* Minor: Conforming to new coding style

10.1.0
------
* Added the ceil_division.hpp for ceiled integer division.

10.0.0
------
* The endian_buffer class has been replaced with an endian_stream that
  provides a stream-like interface over a fixed-size buffer.
* sak::storage() can be created directly from an std::string

9.1.0
-----
* Added sak::equal() for comparing sak::const_storage objects.

9.0.0
------
* Updated to waf 1.7.9 and started using the wurf_install_path tool.
* Removing sak::object and sak::object_id and using typeid for type
  identification in the object registry.

8.1.0
-----
* Updated to use the new external-waf-tools repository.
* Added offset function to storage classes & fixed bug in the
  split_storage function.

8.0.0
-----
* Allow setting a factory function on the object registry
* Object registry is no longer a singleton, changed factory build
  methods to take accept object registry reference.
* Added random input stream.
* Use new mkspec system to building

7.0.0
-----
* Changed object model to no longer use category

6.1.0
-----
* Adding streams, e.g. buffer_input_stream, file_input_stream.

6.0.0
-----
* Bump major version due to an backwards incompatible change in the
  storage.hpp code. Where we have removed the storage_list()
  functions.

5.0.0
-----
* Bump major version due to an backwards incompatible change in the
  object_registry code.

4.4.1
-----
* Fix broken backwards compatibility introduced without bumping the
  major version number.

4.4.0
-----
* Added buffer object for simple buffer management.

4.3.0
-----
* Added the object registry, which allows management and access to
  object factories.

4.2.2
-----
* Fixed custom allocator support for C++11. For win32 a preprocessor
  define is used until variadic template is supported in Visual
  Studio.

4.2.1
-----
* Fixed missing include in object.h

4.2.0
-----
* Added object agregation functionality

4.1.0
------------
* Adding aligned allocator + several utility functions for dealing
  with aligned memory.

4.0.0
-----
* Changing header extension to .hpp from .h which makes it easier to
  differentiate between C and C++ code.
* Added ``endian_buffer`` class for easy serializing and deserializing
  of multi-byte values
* Added the ``duplex_buffer`` class as a container for data which
  supports efficient prepending and appending of data.

3.0.0
-----
* To avoid having include path point to the root of the project we have
  moved the source files to src/sak instead of just sak/.
* Removed obsolete code benchmarking functionality, now replaced by the
  cxx-gauge project.
* Added storage implementation.

2.0.0
-----
* Updated Waf build tool to handle dependencies better. The new tools
  used are not compatible with the old versions so we have to bump the
  major version.

1.1.1
-----
* Updated Waf build tool
* Bumped dependency version for gtest to 1.0.3-gtest_1_6_0
* Bumped dependency version for boost to 1.1.2-boost_1_48_0

1.1.0
-----
* Added helper functions for profiling code
* Bumped dependency version for gtest to 1.0.2-gtest_1_6_0
* Bumped dependency version for boost to 1.1.1-boost_1_48_0
* Fixed win32 link and cxx flags
